# playwallball
I started building this page as a vanilla javascript project

## Description
I wanted to try and create an interactive map to geolocate and tag locations for lacrosse players to play wallball. I realized I didn't have the skills with firebase to set it up, so I decided to take a react/redux course that used firebase, and I decided to build the page with React instead of vanilla JS.
